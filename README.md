I provided the whole excel file used incase someone wanted to attempt using a different file reading method via excel, but the csv included was what I used. 
The model is designed to use a similar dataset layout to predict churners, and from where I have it has a 77% accuracy for predicting churners, but an overall accuracy of 99%
